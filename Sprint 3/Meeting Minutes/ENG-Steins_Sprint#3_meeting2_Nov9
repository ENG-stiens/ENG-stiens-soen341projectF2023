**Agenda Item 1:**
- We were able to collect feedback from our lab TA. From their feedback, we were got the reassurance that we are on the right
path with our product. One important comment fro the TA, is to make sure that the files on our site are seemlessly linked. This gave
us the guidance that we needed to make the our product better.

**Agenda Item 2:**
- From the feedback of our TA, we realised that for the purpose of the demonstration of our website, we don't need a robust database.
Therefore, we decided to change gears, and put more ressources into the front-end of our website for the next sprint.

- Our team brainstormed ideas for Sprint 4, and for the overall final product.
