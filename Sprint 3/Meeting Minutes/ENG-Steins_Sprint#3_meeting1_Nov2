**Agenda:**
1. Go over Sprint #2
2. Figure out team division 
3. Task breakdown

**Agenda Item 1:**
- We assessed and reviewed with the team what was done in sprint 2. With that information, we made some adjustments. 
For instance, we decided that each teammember will assign their own the issues to themselves based on the their task
breakdown. In sprint 2, the 3 front-end developer were each paired with one back-end developer, so every pair was working
on a specific fonctionality. This worked well, so we decided to keep the same method for future sprints. 

**Agenda Item 2:**
- With the new requirments for sprint 3, we assessed that we will be working in the same manner as the previous sprint. The
teams for developing code will stay the same, for simplicity and coherence.

**Agenda Item 3:**
- Using the same process as the previous, we enumerated the tasks, and each person volunteered on which task they'll prefer doing. 
For instance, the search for brokers will be done by Vanisha and Jermina, the submit offer will be done by Sarah and Eden, the database
server will be done Kermina, the acceptance test will be done by Julie and Oleksandra, the unit test will be done by Eden, and meeting
minutes will be done by Oleksandra, and finally, the plan for next sprint will be done by Vanisha.
