September 28, during our Lab section

We had essentially completed all the tasks for Sprint #1, so we initiated discussions regarding Sprint #2. In addition, we met 
with our TA to provide an update on our week's progress. During the discussion, our TA recommended that we start our work on 
the coding aspect and the database. She also recommanded to modify our meeting minutes so that they have paragraphs format.
As a team, we agreed that each team member would take responsibility for either the front-end or back-end framework, depending
on their comfort level and expertise with specific software tools. Finally, for the coding phase, we agreed to implement 
pair coding to ensure a coherent and strategically aligned approach, as learned in class.
