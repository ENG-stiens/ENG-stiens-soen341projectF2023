We discussed via text messages about the task distribution process. We created a Google document containing a comprehensive task list. 
Each team member was assigned the responsibility of associating their name with their preferred task. We then agreed that each one of us
would be dedicated to complete their task before the next lab session. Our aim was to finish our tasks early to allow flexibility 
for potential modifications during Sprint 1, ensuring ample time for adjustments if needed.
