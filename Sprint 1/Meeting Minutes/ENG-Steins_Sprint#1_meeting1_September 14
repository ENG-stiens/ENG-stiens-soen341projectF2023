September 14 during Lab Section :

During the meeting, the team collectively agreed on the name "ENG-stiens." 
A Gmail account was created specifically for Github sign-in. We also added both the teacher assistant (TA) and the instructor to our Github repository. 
Finally, we talked about the distribution of various tasks and the different softwares that we will be comfortable to work with.
