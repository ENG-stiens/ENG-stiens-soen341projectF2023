September 14 during Lab Section :

During the meeting, the team collectively agreed on the name "ENG-stiens." Also, we created a Gmail account specifically for Github sign-in. 
We also added both the teacher assistant (TA) and the instructor to our Github repository. Finally, we talked about the distribution of 
various tasks and the different softwares that we will be comfortable working with.
