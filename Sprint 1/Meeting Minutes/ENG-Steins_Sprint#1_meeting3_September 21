September 21 during Lab Section:

During our meeting, we gathered to talk about the tasks we had completed and realized that we still needed to work on the task breakdown
based on user stories. We discussed about what those tasks can be then we assigned this responsability to a team member but we agreed 
that if anyone of us had an idea of interesting features for the real estate website, he could go and add it on Github. We also presented 
our work to our TA, who recommended that we pay more attention to enhancing our front-end and back-end frameworks. Finally, we appointed 
Sarah as our team leader.
