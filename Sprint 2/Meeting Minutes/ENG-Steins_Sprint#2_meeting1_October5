**Agenda Item 1:**
- The group discussed the progress from last week and consulted our research. We aggreed that we need to communicate more 
  during upcoming sprints and the meeting minutes needs to be more detailed. We liked the way we did the task division for sprint#1 
  so we decided to work the same way.

**Agenda Item 2:**
- The team was broken into 3 groups of two to tackle the main pages of the website. 
  Each page has a student who is responsible for back-end and front-end of the section.
  We aggreed that Julie, Kermina and Eden will be in charge of back-end and Vanisha, Sasha and Sarah
  will be responsible of front-end.


**Agenda Item 3:**
- To divide the tasks, we went over sprint #2 instructions and we would see if there is a volunteer for a specific task.
  We agreed that Julie and Oleksandra will be responsible for the acceptance tests and the CRUD operations on properties.
  Vanisha and Kermina will be responsible for CRUD operations for brokers.
  Sarah and Eden will be responsible for search for propertiesmand the requests to visit properties 

**Agenda Item 4:**
- While we were sitting together in the lab, we brainstormed multiple database software we could use
  like MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB and Microsoft SQL. We didn't have sufficient knowledge about databases
  so we aggreed that we will do some research to chose the most suitable one for our project.
