**Agenda Item 1:**
-In our project group, we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that every task is close to completion. We've created 
a group reminder listing all the functionalities for sprint #2, along with the names of the individuals responsible for 
each task. Additionally, we've made sure that the pipeline, acceptance tests, meeting minutes, plans for the next sprint,
and detailed logs are nearly finished. We've  also reminded each other to evaluate our teammates using the form provided 
by the professor. While most of the tasks have been accomplished, we do have a few adjustments to make to ensure the website
