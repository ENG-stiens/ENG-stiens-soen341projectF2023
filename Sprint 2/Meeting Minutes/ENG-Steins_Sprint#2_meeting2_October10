3. Updates on back-end and front-end


**Agenda Item 1:**
- After some researches, we aggreed to use MySQL for our database. MySQL Workbench is a great choice for managing databases because 
  it's easy to use, has powerful features, and lots of helpful people to assist. It helps you design, control, and improve databases, 
  making it handy for developers. Plus, it's free and works well with MySQL databases, so it's a smart pick for anyone dealing with data.
  Kermina volunteered to set up the database. We also talked about finding a free server for us to be able to store, manage, and provide access
  to the data efficiently. 

**Agenda Item 2:**
- We created a milestone on Github to choose the color theme for the website. Each one of us went on Github and voted for their preferred theme.
  We were not able to talk much about back-end since the progress was not going that fast.
