**Agenda:**
1. Login page restrictions
2. Website appearence & Progression in tasks

**Agenda Item 1:**
- On the login page, we proposed implementing certain restrictions to prevent scenarios where, for instance, 
  a homebuyer would have access to sensitive information intended only for the system administrator. To achieve this, 
  we considered requesting identification numbers from brokers and system administrators, allowing them to access specific 
  details related to property listings and clients. After further discussion on this feature, we decided to set it aside
  in order to concentrate our efforts on the core functionalities for sprint #2.

**Agenda Item 2:**
- The front-end team has developed an initial framework for the user interface. All team members have reviewed this framework, 
  and we reached a consensus regarding the website's visual design. There are some remaining adjustments to be made, such as 
  finalizing the search bar, which will be completed later. On the back-end side, the databases for properties available for sale, 
  properties available for rent, and information about brokers were already created and ready to use. Given that the database connection
  is local, we have decided to include a duplicate copy of the database to ensure uniform naming conventions throughout our codebase.
  Each team member was still working on their assigned task and the project is progressing smoothly.
