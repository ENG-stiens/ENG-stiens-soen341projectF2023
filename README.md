## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the software development process, employing Agile methodologies and leveraging GitHub's tools, including version control, access control, and bug tracking. The project consists of four iterative sprints spanning 10 to 12 weeks.

### Project Overview

We are building a real estate web application designed to streamline property transactions, encompassing buying, selling, and renting. This platform caters to four primary user roles:

- **Homebuyers:** Homebuyers can search for properties based on specific criteria, save favorites, request property visits, search for brokers, and use a mortgage calculator for estimating monthly payments.

- **Property Renters:** Property renters have similar features to homebuyers but exclude the mortgage calculator.

- **Brokers:** Real estate brokers can submit offers on behalf of clients, manage property listings, match properties with potential buyers, review and manage offers, and schedule property visits.

- **System Administrators:** Administrators oversee broker management with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Project Approach and Technology

Approach: We have adopted an Agile development methodology for this project, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. Agile permits us to adapt to changing requirements. This ensures that the project aligns closely with the needs and expectations of our stakeholders (aka the TAs).

Technology: To accomplish a fully functioning real-estate website, many languages and frameworks can be used. Here's a brief over view of the possibilities.

**Front-end:**
- HTML
  - pros: Universality (accessible on all browsers), familiarity
  - cons: Requires additional CSS for styling
  
- Javascript
  - pros: Allows dynamic content, familiarity, broad library support
  - cons: Can impact load time if it's a heavy-duty project, needs to be optimised
  
- Angular.js
  - pros: Efficient (two-way data binding and dynamic), unfamiliarity
  - cons: Steep learning curve, heavyweight for smaller projects (can affect performance)

**Backend:** 
- PHP
  - pros: Efficient for handling the server, familiarity
  - cons: May not be as fast as othe backend technologies
  
- Django (Python)
  - pros: Offers strong security, robust
  - cons: Steep learning curve, heavyweight for smaller projects
  
- Express.js
  - pros: Easy to learn, good performance
  - cons: less guidance (because it's less popular)

For this project we will be using HTML, JavaScript and PHP. To make this choice, we looked among other things at feasibility, compatibility, cost-efficieny. 
There are many benefits to use these languages to accomplish our project. Firstly, most of the people on the team are familiar with these languages. This would facilitate the communication and collaboration among team members as they work on the project. Also, the languages we have chosen are cross-platform compatible. This feature is particularly beneficial as our team members who use various types of computers, ensuring that everyone can contribute without compatibility issues. In addition, the languages will ensure that our final product is available on different types of browsers and platforms, thus reaching more users. Also, using these ressources are cost-efficient as the team does not need to invest in any additional software or tool development. These technologies are open-source, allowing us to use multiple libraries and frameworks that can easily speed up out developping process. In concusion, choosing to use HTML, JavaScript and PHP is a good strategic decision that is leveraging familiarity, cross-platform compatibility, cost-efficiency and flexibility. 



## User Stories
### 1. Homebuyer:

As a homebuyer, I want to be able to login into my account to search for property based on the location, number of rooms and the year it was built. This type of search allows a better experience as a user to find a convient property. If I find a home that I like then I would save it as a favourite which would make my home seletion a lot easier and accessible. Brokers are an important aspect when buying a house, therefore I need to search for brokers and select the one I am most comfortable with. Through the real estate website, I need to request a property visit to be able to get a better look at the house before I make a descision. Based on the mortgage calculator, I am able to see how much I would need to pay monthly based on loan amount and intrest rate.     
 
### 2. Property renter:

As a property renter, I want to be able to login into my account to search for property based on the location, number of rooms and the year it was built. This type of search allows a better expereince as a renter to find a convient property. If I find a home that I like then I would save it as a favourite which makes my home seletion a lot easier and accessible. Brokers are an important aspect when buying a house, therefore I need to search for brokers and select the one I am most comfortable with. Through the real estate website, I need to request a property visit to be able to get a better look at the house before I make a descision.

   
### 3. Broker:

As a broker, I need to login into my account to sumbit offers for buying properties on behalf of my clients so that I can also track the status of the offers. Through the website, I want to also request a property visit for my clients. For my appointments, I need a tool that allows me to manage my visits by rescheduling or cancelling. Also, when I present a property, I want to review and manage the offers made by the homebuyers. Matching properties to potential buyers based on their preferances is also very important for a broker. As a broker, I also need to create, read, update and delete properties.  

  
### 4. System adminstartor:

As a system administrator, I need to login into my account to create, read, update and delete brokers from the website to keep it authentic and reliable.
