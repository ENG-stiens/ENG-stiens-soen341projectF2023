## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the software development process, employing Agile methodologies and leveraging GitHub's tools, including version control, access control, and bug tracking. The project consists of four iterative sprints spanning 10 to 12 weeks.

### Project Overview

We are building a real estate web application designed to streamline property transactions, encompassing buying, selling, and renting. This platform caters to four primary user roles:

- **Homebuyers:** Homebuyers can search for properties based on specific criteria, save favorites, request property visits, search for brokers, and use a mortgage calculator for estimating monthly payments.

- **Property Renters:** Property renters have similar features to homebuyers but exclude the mortgage calculator.

- **Brokers:** Real estate brokers can submit offers on behalf of clients, manage property listings, match properties with potential buyers, review and manage offers, and schedule property visits.

- **System Administrators:** Administrators oversee broker management with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
