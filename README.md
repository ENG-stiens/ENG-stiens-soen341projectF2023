## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the software development process, employing Agile methodologies and leveraging GitHub's tools, including version control, access control, and bug tracking. The project consists of four iterative sprints spanning 10 to 12 weeks.

### Project Overview

We are building a real estate web application designed to streamline property transactions, encompassing buying, selling, and renting. This platform caters to four primary user roles:

- **Homebuyers:** Homebuyers can search for properties based on specific criteria, save favorites, request property visits, search for brokers, and use a mortgage calculator for estimating monthly payments.

- **Property Renters:** Property renters have similar features to homebuyers but exclude the mortgage calculator.

- **Brokers:** Real estate brokers can submit offers on behalf of clients, manage property listings, match properties with potential buyers, review and manage offers, and schedule property visits.

- **System Administrators:** Administrators oversee broker management with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Technology: For this project we will be using HTML, JavaScript and PHP.

## User Stories
1. Homebuyer:

As a homebuyer, I want to be able to search for property based on the location, number of rooms and the year it was built. This type of search allows a better expereince as a user to find a convient property. If I find a home that I like then I would save it as a favourite which made my home seletion a lot easier and accessible. Brokers are an important aspect when buying a house, therefore I needed to search for bokers and select the one I am most comfortable with. Through the real estate website, I requested a property visit to be able to get a better look at the house before I make a descision. Based on the mortgage calculator, I was able to see how much I would pay monthly based on loan amount and intrest rate.

As a broker, I need to sumbit offers for buying properties on behalf of my clients so that I can also track the status of the offers. Through the website, I want to also request a property visit for my clients. When I present a property, I want to review and manage the offers made by the homebuyers.
