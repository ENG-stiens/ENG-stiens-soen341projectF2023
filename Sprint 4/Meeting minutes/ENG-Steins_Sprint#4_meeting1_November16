**Meeting Minutes**

**Meeting Date:** November 16 2023
**Meeting Time:** During Lab Section
**Meeting Location:** Lab room

**Attendees:**
- Sarah
- Julie
- Eden
- Vanisha


**Agenda:**
1. Go over Sprint #3
2. Task breakdown
3. Database


**Agenda Item 1:**
- The group discussed the progress done in sprint #3. We were satisfied by our teamwork progress, but we agreed we should talk 
  more often and keep each other informed about our individual tasks.

**Agenda Item 2:**
- To divide the tasks, we went over sprint #4 instructions and we created a google document with the diffrent tasks. 
  If there is a volunteer for a specific task, he would simply put his name beside it.
  We agreed that Julie and Kermina will be responsible for the 2 acceptance tests.
  Vanisha will be responsible for the log in page and the reorganization of the files structure.
  Sarah will be responsible for the mortgage calculator.
  Eden will be responsible for the offer managment and the unit test.
  Finally, for the code review, we aggreed that everyone of us will review our code and leave comments if necessary.

**Agenda Item 3:**
- As a team, we collectively decided to switch to hardcoding all the necessary data. Managing the database and server was becoming
  increasingly challenging, so we agreed that each team member would update their code from previous sprints to align with this new decision. 
  Hardcoding was chosen for its simplicity, reducing code complexity, making it more understandable, and maintaining client-side performance. 
  Hardcoded data will also improve the performance of our website since the data is readily available in the code.
