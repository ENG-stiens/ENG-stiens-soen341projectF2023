2. Task breakdown
3. Database


**Agenda Item 1:**
- The group discussed the progress done in sprint #3. We liked the way we were working as a team to create a good product but we aggreed 
  that we still needed to communicate more often and give each other updates on our individual work.
  

**Agenda Item 2:**
- To divide the tasks, we went over sprint #4 instructions and we created a google document with the diffrent tasks. If there is a volunteer for a 
  specific task, he would simply put his name beside it.
  We agreed that Julie and Kermina will be responsible for the 2 acceptance tests.
  Vanisha will be responsible for the log in page and the reorganization of the files structure.
  Sarah will be responsible for the mortgage calculator.
  Eden will be responsible for the offer managment and the unit test.
  Finally, for the code review, we aggreed that everyone of us will review our code and leave comments if necessary.

**Agenda Item 3:**
- We took a decision as a group to hardcode every data we need since it was getting more hard to manage the database and the server.
