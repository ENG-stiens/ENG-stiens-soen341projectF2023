- We went over the oral presentation to make sure we're all prepared for it. We modified some things in the shared PowerPoint 
  to match the template given by the professor.

**Agenda Item 2:**
- To divide the tasks for the report, we decided to proceed the same way we did for the sprint #4 task division. We created another 
  google document with the diffrent tasks and a space allocated for the resonsable name. We aggreed that everyone will
  work on their part, then on thursday, during the lab, we would go over it to make sure everything is complete before the deadline.
  

**Agenda Item 3:**
- Following our discussion, we can conclude that everything is going smoothly for sprint #4. We only need to make some minor modifications to complete it.
